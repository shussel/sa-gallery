# sa-gallery

SA gallery is a Wordpress plugin to create image galleries with proportional image display. As a hobby photographer who shoots in many formats, I was dissatisfied with regular sizing functions which minimize the visual size of vertically oriented images. This plugin updates Wordpress image sizing routines so that all images are given roughly the same display area, so a page with mixed vertical and horizontal images appears more uniform and doesn't favor either one. For an example, see https://shanesadventure.com/photography/gallery/machu-picchu/
